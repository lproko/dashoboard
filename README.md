# Simple Dashboard Project

This repository contains a dashboard application designed to visualize shipment and operational data. It is developed using React for the frontend and leverages a lightweight JSON-server as a backend for demonstration purposes.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- **backend/**: Contains the backend logic and APIs that power the application.
- **shipments-dashboard/**: The frontend part, where the user interface is implemented.

## Prerequisites

Before running this project locally, ensure the following software is installed:

- **Node.js**: (preferably the latest LTS version)
- **npm** or **Yarn**: For managing project dependencies

## Installation & Setup

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the `backend` directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the backend server
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the shipments-dashboard directory
   ```bash
   cd shipments-dashboard
   ```
2. Install the required frontend dependencies
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the frontend application

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   After completing these steps, you should be able to visit the dashboard at http://localhost:5173 (or a different port specified in the terminal).
